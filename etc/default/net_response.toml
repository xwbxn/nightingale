## Protocol, must be "tcp" or "udp"
## NOTE: because the "udp" protocol does not respond to requests, it requires
## a send/expect string pair (see below).
protocol = "{{.protocol}}"

## Set timeout
# timeout = "1s"

## Set read timeout (only used if expecting a response)
# read_timeout = "1s"

## The following options are required for UDP checks. For TCP, they are
## optional. The plugin will send the given string to the server and then
## expect to receive the given 'expect' string back.
## string sent to the server
# send = "ssh"
## expected string in answer
# expect = "ssh"
