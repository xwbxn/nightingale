# This is an example:
#     receive spans from jaeger, send to jaeger and zipkin, with three extensions enabled.
# See factories we already supported:
#     ./config/traces/components.go
# For more details, see the OpenTelemetry official docs:

traces:
  # set enable to true to start tracing
  enable: false

  # Extensions: 
  #   provide capabilities that can be added to the Collector, but which do not require direct access to telemetry data 
  #   and are not part of pipelines. They are also enabled within the service section.

  # Service:
  #   used to configure what components are enabled in the Collector based on the configuration found in the receivers, 
  #   processors, exporters, and extensions sections. If a component is configured, but not defined within the service 
  #   section then it is not enabled. The service section consists of three sub-sections:
  #     - extensions: Extensions consist of a list of all extensions to enable. 
  #     - pipelines: A pipeline consists of a set of receivers, processors and exporters.
  #     - telemetry: Telemetry is where the telemetry for the collector itself can be configured.
